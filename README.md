## Summary
 This library is the assisted tool for the development of aircraft and propulsive system.
 
 You can do the followings.
 - Computation for aircraft and propulsive system's performance
 - Computation for aircraft and propulsive system's physical values
 - Simultaneously optimization of aircraft and propulsive system
 - Visualize the computational results
 - Speeding Up and Simplification to the performance module by machine learning
 - Simulate aircraft in the environment and conduct the learning for autonomous driving or optimal path planning
 

## Installation

- python3.7
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

## Tips
 There are mainly three usages in this library.
 
**1.** **Visualize the aircraft or propulsive system from given design variables**
---

'''python:hello.py
print(hello)
'''

**2.** **Optimize the shape and performance to aircraft or propulsive system**
---

'python3 optimize.py --args'

**3.** **Conduct the exploration and acquisition of policy for driving or flying**
---
